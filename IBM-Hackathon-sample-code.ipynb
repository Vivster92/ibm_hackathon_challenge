Emergence of new viruses is currently considered one of the biggest existential threats facing humanity. In 1918, a world-wide flu outbreak killed over 50 million people around the world. Ebola virus is thought to have come from bats, HIV virus is thought to have come from monkeys, SARS virus potentially came from birds, and many more. We can today sequence thousands of viruses in animals but it is hard to identify which of the tens of thousands of viruses present in wild and domestic animals could potentially cross over to infect humans. Thus, a computational model to predict whether an animal virus can infect humans would be of huge importance.\n","\n","Training Data: Genome sequences of 70 human viruses that can be easily transmitted from animals to humans, e.g. ebola (Class Label: Zoonotic) and sequences of another 70 viruses that cannot be easily transmitted from animals to humans (Class Label: Non-Zoonotic).\n","\n","The genome sequences are basically a string of 4 characters (AGCT) and the sequence of each virus ranges from 2000 letters to 10,000 characters. If you feel the training/test dataset is small, an option is to fragment each virus genome into smaller pieces which could easily create a training set of 5,000 to 10,000 samples in each class (i.e we can fragment each viral genome into 100 pieces).\n","\n","Test Data: 60 Genome sequences with the class label hidden from participants but provided to hackathon organizers (30 from each class).\n","\n","Evaluation: Participants will have to provide a deep learning model and their predictions for each provided test sample. Evaluation will be based on the follwing two criteria:\n","\n","    Most innovative model\n","    Performance based on AUC/ precision-recall curves"]},{"metadata":{"id":"RkEocJS8UaiN","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Let's get started.
